# LeaderLidar CI and Release Automation

This project is to help automate the Continuous Integration (CI) and Release processes for LeaderLidar, a car safety vendor company. The company's primary product, LeaderLidar, is comprised of two packages: telemetry and analytics.

The following tasks were completed:

* Setup and configured a CI environment using Gitlab, Artifactory, and Jenkins in AWS.

* Implemented branch specific tasks for telemetry and analytics repositories, including build, test and deployment actions.


* Implemented end-to-end testing using a simulator and executing tests from test files.

* Created a Multi-Branch Pipeline (MBP) in Jenkins that performs both CI and Release according to the instructions provided.
Configured remote artifact repositories in pom.xmls or settings.xml.
